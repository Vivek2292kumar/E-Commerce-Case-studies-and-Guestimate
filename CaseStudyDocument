                                                 PART - II

1. What percentage of total retail sales in 2025 will be conducted through e-commerce platforms?
Approach: Demand-Side Estimation
 We estimate the total e-commerce sales using global retail sales projections and the e-commerce penetration rate.
Methodology:
Global retail sales in 2025 (estimated): $30 trillion (Statista).
E-commerce penetration rate (2025 projection): ~16.4% (eMarketer).
Formula:
 E-commerce Sales = Total Retail Sales × E-commerce Penetration Rate
 $30T × 16.4% = $4.92T
Amazon’s share in global e-commerce (2025 estimated): ~12% (Statista, Business Insider).
Amazon’s total sales:
 $4.92T × 12% = $590B
 E-commerce will contribute ~$4.92 trillion (16.4% of total retail sales) in 2025.
Amazon’s estimated e-commerce sales: $590 billion.

2. How much will the average online shopper spend annually in 2025?
Approach: Demand-Side Estimation
 We estimate spending per user by dividing total e-commerce sales by the number of online shoppers.
Methodology:
Total e-commerce sales in 2025: $4.92 trillion (from Q1 calculation).
Total online shoppers (2025 estimate): ~4.9 billion (Statista, UNCTAD).
Formula:
 Average Spend Per Shopper = Total E-commerce Sales / Total Online Shoppers
 $4.92T / 4.9B = $1,004 USD per user annually
Amazon’s active customers: ~310 million (Amazon Annual Report).
Amazon’s per-user spend:
 $590B / 310M ≈ $1,900 USD per Amazon user
An average online shopper will spend ~$1,004 annually in 2025.
Amazon users will spend ~$1,900 per year.

3. What will be the market share of mobile e-commerce (m-commerce) in total e-commerce sales in the next five years?
Approach: Demand-Side Estimation
 We project mobile commerce based on historical growth trends and market share.
Methodology:
Current m-commerce share (2023): ~72% of total e-commerce (Statista, Insider Intelligence).


Expected annual growth rate: ~5% increase per year (eMarketer).


Projected m-commerce share (2025):
 72% + 5% = 75%


Mobile-driven e-commerce sales in 2025:
 $4.92T × 75% = $3.69T


Amazon’s mobile-driven sales:
 $590B × 75% = $442B
By 2025, mobile commerce will contribute 75% of total e-commerce ($3.69T).
Amazon’s mobile sales will be ~$442B.

4. What is the estimated increase in the number of e-commerce websites in the next three years?
Approach: Demand-Side Estimation
 We use a projected growth rate to estimate the increase in the number of e-commerce websites.
Methodology:
Current e-commerce websites (2023): ~26 million (Business.com).
Annual growth rate: ~12% per year (Statista, Shopify data).
Formula (compound growth):
 Future Value = Current Value × (1 + Growth Rate) ^ n
Projected e-commerce websites in 2028:
 2025: $26M × 1.12^2 ≈ 32.6M$
 2026: $32.6M × 1.12 ≈ 36.5M$
 2027: $36.5M × 1.12 ≈ 40.9M$
 2028: $40.9M × 1.12 ≈ 45.8M$
The number of e-commerce websites will grow to ~45.8 million by 2028.


5. How much will global e-commerce sales grow annually over the next five years?
Approach: Demand-Side Estimation
 We use CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) to estimate future e-commerce growth.
Methodology:
Current global e-commerce sales (2023): ~$5.8 trillion (eMarketer, Statista).
Expected CAGR (2023-2028): ~10-12% (McKinsey, IBISWorld).
Formula (compound growth):
 Future Value = Current Value × (1 + Growth Rate) ^ n
Projected 2028 market size:
 $5.8T × (1.12^5) ≈ 10.2T$


Amazon’s estimated market share (assuming stable dominance at ~12%):
 $10.2T × 12% = 1.22T$
Global e-commerce sales will reach ~$10.2 trillion by 2028. 
Amazon’s sales could grow to ~$1.22 trillion.















Scenario Based Questions
Scenario 1:
The company is launching a subscription service where customers can subscribe to receive products every month at a discounted rate. They want to understand how the retention of subscription customers compares to regular customers who do not subscribe.
Question 1:
How would you compare the retention rates of subscription customers versus non-subscription customers? What metrics would you focus on, and how would you structure the cohort analysis?
To compare retention rates, I would conduct a cohort analysis by dividing customers into two groups:
Subscription Customers – Those who opted for the subscription model.
Non-Subscription Customers – Those who made one-time purchases.
Key Metrics to Track:
Customer Retention Rate = (Customers retained at month X / Total customers at the start) * 100
Average Order Frequency – How often customers purchase within a given timeframe.
Repeat Purchase Rate – % of customers making another purchase after their first.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) – Total revenue a customer generates over their relationship with Amazon.
Churn Rate – Percentage of customers who stop purchasing.
Cohort Analysis Structure:
Track retention over multiple months (e.g., 1-month, 3-month, 6-month retention).
Compare trends: Is there a higher drop-off in non-subscription customers?
Use survival analysis to determine how long customers stay active.
Visualize findings using retention curves.
Question 2:
Suppose you find that subscription customers have a 20% higher retention rate after 3 months compared to non-subscription customers. What recommendations would you make to the business based on this finding?
If subscription customers show a 20% higher retention rate, I would recommend the following:
Increase Subscription Adoption:
Offer a first-month free trial or discount on the first three months.
Highlight savings and convenience in marketing campaigns.
Use email and push notifications to remind users of their subscription benefits.
Improve the Subscription Experience:
Offer flexibility (pause, modify, or cancel subscriptions easily).
Add exclusive benefits such as early access to deals or free shipping.
Personalize product recommendations for subscribers.
Target Non-Subscribers:
Identify high-potential non-subscribers based on purchase history.
Offer one-time buyers a discounted upgrade to a subscription.
Send targeted reminders showcasing the benefits of subscribing.
Monitor & Optimize:
Conduct surveys to understand why non-subscribers hesitate.
Perform A/B testing on subscription signup pages.
Track churn reasons and improve pain points in the subscription model.
Scenario 2:
The company is testing two different landing pages for new users. Version A emphasises discounted products, while Version B highlights the quality and premium nature of products. The company wants to know which version drives more conversions (i.e., purchases).
Question 1:
How would you design an A/B test to determine which landing page (Version A or Version B) performs better in terms of conversion rate?
To test which landing page (A: Discount-focused vs. B: Quality-focused) performs better, I would follow these steps:
Define Key Metrics:
Conversion Rate (CR) = (Purchases / Total Visitors) * 100
Bounce Rate – % of users leaving without interacting.
Average Order Value (AOV) – How much customers spend per order.
Revenue per Visitor (RPV) – Revenue generated per site visit.
Ensure Random Assignment:
Use an A/B testing tool (e.g., Amazon's internal tools, Optimizely, Google Optimize).
Randomly assign 50% of users to Version A and 50% to Version B.
Set a Testing Period & Sample Size:
Ensure a statistically significant sample size (use tools like A/B test calculators).
Run the test for at least 2-4 weeks, depending on traffic volume.
Analyze Results:
Check which version has a higher conversion rate and other key metrics.
Perform statistical significance testing (e.g., p-value < 0.05) to confirm reliability.
Question 2:
After running the A/B test, you find that Version B has a higher conversion rate, but the difference is not statistically significant. What would you do next? Should the company adopt Version B, or continue with Version A?
Since the difference is not statistically significant, I would take the following steps:
Extend the Testing Period
If the test duration was too short, continue running it for more data.
Seasonal trends may impact user behavior, so consider external factors.
Increase Sample Size
If the sample size is small, increase the number of visitors assigned to each version.
Use statistical power calculations to determine the necessary sample size.
Segment the Results
Analyze results by customer type (new vs. returning users).
Check if specific demographics respond better to Version B.
Perform a Multivariate Test
Instead of just two versions, test different variations (e.g., combining discounts & premium messaging).
Experiment with CTA button colors, images, and page layouts.
Use Additional Metrics
Even if conversion rates are similar, check Average Order Value (AOV) or Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
If Version B attracts higher-value customers, it may still be beneficial.
Final Recommendation:
If after all refinements, Version B still does not show a statistically significant advantage, stick with Version A.
If Version B starts showing consistent improvement in conversions, AOV, or customer retention, consider rolling it out permanently.
